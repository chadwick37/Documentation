doc.umentation
=============

A simple application for building documentation for your app. Uses [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/), [Paris/Idiorm](http://j4mie.github.io/idiormandparis/), [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), and [Bootstrap v2.3.1](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).

Why? There are other applications but I wanted something that can be setup and used within 5 minutes. Use doc.umentation when you don't need a full blown wiki or auto documentation.

## Setup

Most of the setup is already done for you.

* Clone or download the repository and place on your webserver.
* Use the base MySQL database to setup your database
* Update config.php with your database settings
* Go to http://yourwebsite.com/admin/add to create content
* Edit templates/home.twig to customize the home page

## To Do

* Add user authentication for admin area access
