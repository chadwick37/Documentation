<h1>doc.umentation</h1>
	<p class="lead">A super simple app for documenting your app. Think of <b>doc.umentation</b> as an easy way to generate the userguide you never have time to build. Now you do because <b>doc.umentation</b> makes it so easy.</p>
	<h3>Benefits of doc.umentation</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>5 minute setup</li>
		<li>Easy to generate content</li>
		<li>Easy to manage content</li>
		<li>Easy to link to content</li>
		<li>Free your time because now your users have a place to get their questions answered.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Why build doc.umentation? Because sometimes you need something quick and simple. It takes less than 5 minutes to setup and is super easy to use. If you don't need a full blown wiki or want the overhead of something like Wordpress, then doc.umentation may be for you.</p>
